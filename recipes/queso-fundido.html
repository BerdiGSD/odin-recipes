  <h3>Ingredients Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>4 ounces Mexican-style chorizo</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 fluid ounces tequila (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 pound Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package white Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>2 plum tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps for preparing:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>eat oil in a 9-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add chorizo;
      cook, stirring to crumble, until browned and cooked through, about 5
      minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Drain any excess fat from the
      skillet.</li>
      <li>Without cleaning the skillet, add bell peppers and onion. Cook over
      medium-high heat, stirring often, until browned and softened, about 5
      minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in tequila. Continue cooking
      vegetables, stirring often, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Using a
      slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Stir together Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses in a bowl; spread 1/3
      in the skillet. Add 1/3 of the vegetables, then 1/3 of the chorizo. Repeat
      with 2 more layers, ending with chorizo. Sprinkle with chili powder.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheeses are melted and bubbling,
      about 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with tomatoes, cilantro, and
      salt. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
